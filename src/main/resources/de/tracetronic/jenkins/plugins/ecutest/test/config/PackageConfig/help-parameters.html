<div>
    Definition of ECU-TEST package parameters consisting of a unique name and a value.<br/>
    Numeric value entries will be automatically converted to <i>Numeric</i> type in ECU-TEST.<br/>
    For now only <i>Numeric</i> and <i>String</i> types are supported. <br/>
    <b>Note:</b> From <b>ECU-TEST Version 2022.3</b> on, no invalid control characters are recognized anymore! In
    particular, this means that backslashes in Windows paths need to be escaped (<i>C:\\my\\path</i> instead of
    <i>C:\my\path</i>), such that 'Backslash - next character' is not interpreted as escape sequence, avoiding an error
    in ECU-TEST.
