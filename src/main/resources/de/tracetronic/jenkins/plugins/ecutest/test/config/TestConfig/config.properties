constants.description=The configured global constants remain available throughout the entire test execution without \
        changing their values. <b>Note:</b> From <b>ecu.test Version 2022.3</b> on, no invalid control characters are \
        recognized anymore! In particular, this means that backslashes in Windows paths need to be escaped \
        (<i>C:\\\\my\\\\path</i> instead of <i>C:\\my\\path</i>), such that 'Backslash - next character' is not \
        interpreted as escape sequence, avoiding an error in ecu.test.
