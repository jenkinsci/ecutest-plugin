<div>
    Definition of global constants consisting of an unique name and a value. Numeric value entries will be automatically
    converted to a <i>Python integer literal</i>, or to a <i>Python string literal</i>.<br/>
    If the global constant does not exist it is created and saved instantly in the current test configuration.
    <b>Note:</b> From <b>ECU-TEST Version 2022.3</b> on, no invalid control characters are recognized anymore! In
    particular, this means that backslashes in Windows paths need to be escaped (<i>C:\\my\\path</i> instead of
    <i>C:\my\path</i>), such that 'Backslash - next character' is not interpreted as escape sequence, avoiding an error
    in ECU-TEST.
